/******************************************************************************
 * This file is auto-generated by Vaadin.
 * If you want to customize the routes manually, you have to:
 * - copy this file or create your own `routes.tsx` in your frontend directory
 *   and modify this copied/created file. By default, the `routes.tsx` file
 *   should be in `src/main/frontend/` folder;
 * - use helper method `buildRoute` to configure routes for the application.
 *
 * `buildRoute` combines a File System-based route configuration or your explicit
 * routes configuration with the server-side routes:
 *
 * - `buildRoute()` with no parameters uses File System-based routes
 * autoconfiguration and adds server-side routes automatically;
 * - `buildRoute(routes)` with one parameter adds the manually configured route
 * object (see `routing` object example below) and adds the server-side routes on
 * the same level of routing hierarchy, as for the given routes;
 * - `buildRoute(routes, serverSidePosition)` with two parameters adds the
 * manually configured routes object and adds the server-side routes onto the
 * given position `serverSidePosition` in the route's hierarchy (see example below).
 *
 * `buildRoute` method returns resolved routes.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - You need to restart the dev-server after adding the new `routes.tsx` file.
 * After that, all modifications to `routes.tsx` are recompiled automatically.
 * - You may need to change a routes import in `index.tsx`, if `index.tsx`
 * exists in the frontend folder (not in generated folder) and you copied the file,
 * as the import isn't updated automatically by Vaadin in this case.
